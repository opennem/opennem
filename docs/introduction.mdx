<Note>Open Electricity is currently in the process of being renamed from OpenNEM. There are still some repostories and projects yet to be renamed</Note>

Open Electricity (formerly OpenNEM) is a platform for tracking and visualizing energy data from across Australia.

The Open Electricity project aims to make energy network data accessible to a wider audience of users and developersthrough a website portal and data access API's and tools.

The Open Electricity project consists of two major components: the website and the API platform.

## Website

The [Open Electricity website](https://explorer.openelectricity.org.au) is a public website that provides a tracker for energy data from across Australia.

 * Explore energy data from across Australia
 * [Facilities](https://explore.openelectricity.org.au/facilities/nem/): Map of Australian power station facilities and their data.
 * [Compare regions](https://explore.openelectricity.org.au/compare/?range=all-12-mth-rolling&interval=1M&metric=renewablesProportion) - Compare energy data across regions.
 * [Stripes](https://explore.openelectricity.org.au/stripes/nem/) - A visualization of the energy data history.
 * [Emissions](https://explore.openelectricity.org.au/emissions/au/?interval=Year&projections=false&history=false) - Visualisation of Australia's emissions.

## API Platform

<Note>The Open Electricity Platform and client libraries are currently in beta and still under active development.</Note>

* [Open Electricity Platform](https://platform.openelectricity.org.au) - Signup for access to the API platform ([docs](/platform/introduction)).
* [Python client library](https://github.com/opennem/openelectricity-python) - Python client library for the Open Electricity API ([docs](/sdk/overview)).
* [TypeScript client library](https://github.com/opennem/openelectricity-typescript) - TypeScript client library for the Open Electricity API ([docs](/sdk/overview)).

## Supported Data Sets

Currently supported electricity networks and data sources:

* `NEM` - [Australia National Electricity Market](https://www.nemweb.com.au/) - energy network data for Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory
* `WEM` - [Australia Western Electricity Market](http://data.wa.aemo.com.au/) - energy network data for Western Australia
* `APVI` - [APVI](https://apvi.org.au) - Rooftop solar data for Australia
* `BoM` - [Bureau of Meteorology](https://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/) - weather data for Australia

## Overview

The OpenElectricity platform tracks electricity generation facilities across Australia's electricity markets. This guide explains how facility data is structured, accessed, and interpreted. Test edit.

## Facility Structure

Each facility in the system is represented by several interconnected data structures:

### Core Facility Data

- Unique facility code (`DUID`)
- Facility name and description
- Network location (`NEM`/`WEM`)
- Network region (e.g., `NSW1`, `VIC1`)
- Operational status
- Wikipedia references and external links

### Generation Units

Units within facilities are tracked with:

- Unit codes and numbers
- Registered capacity
- Fuel technology type
- Emissions factors
- Registration and deregistration dates
- Expected closure dates

## Fuel Technologies

Facilities are categorized by fuel technology types:

### Renewable Technologies

- Solar (utility and rooftop)
- Wind
- Hydro
- Battery storage (charging/discharging)
- Bioenergy (biomass, biogas)

### Non-Renewable Technologies

- Coal (black and brown)
- Gas (OCGT, CCGT)
- Distillate
- Liquid fuel

## Status Tracking

Facilities are tracked through various operational states:

### Status Types

- Operating: Currently generating
- Commissioning: Being tested
- Announced: Planned facility
- Mothballed: Temporarily closed
- Retired: Permanently closed

### Status Updates

- Status changes are tracked historically
- Includes dates of status changes
- Maintains audit trail of facility lifecycle

## Emissions Tracking

### Emissions Data

- CO2 emissions factors per facility
- Total emissions calculations
- Emissions intensity tracking
- Source references for emissions factors

### Environmental Impact

Track environmental performance through:

- Carbon intensity metrics
- Renewable vs non-renewable generation
- Emissions reduction tracking

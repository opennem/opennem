Along with the [tracker website](https://explore.openelectricity.org.au), Open Electricity also provides a platform for programmatically accessing energy data.

The platform provides a REST API and a suite of client libraries for accessing the data, and a dashboard to monitor usage and manage API keys.

You can signup for access to the platform at [platform.openelectricity.org.au](https://platform.openelectricity.org.au).

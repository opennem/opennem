<Warning>The OpenElectricity Platform is currently in beta and still under active development.</Warning>

Along with the [tracker website](https://explore.openelectricity.org.au), OpenElectricity also provides a platform for programatically accessing energy data.

The platform provides a REST API and a suite of client libraries for accessing the data, and dashboard to monitor usage and manage API keys.

<Note>While in beta you will need to join a waitlist. We will be onboarding users as quickly as possible.</Note>
You can signup for access to the platform at [platform.openelectricity.org.au](https://platform.openelectricity.org.au).

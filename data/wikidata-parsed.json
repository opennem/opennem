The turbines are primarily fuelled by natural gas supplied from the Brooklyn-Lara gas pipeline but, in the event of a gas supply curtailment, they can burn low sulphur emission heavy oil as a backup fuel. The plant is normally operated remotely from Snowy Hydro Limited's central control room in Cooma, New South Wales, but is also equipped to be run locally.Snowy Hydro contracted Siemens to complete the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) for the project. Initial civil works started in October 2004 and the station was commissioned in December 2006.The original licence only allowed the power station to operate for 10% of the year, but in May 2007 Snowy Hydro applied for an emergency extension of operating hours because a drought had affected hydro energy supplies.

In June 2014 Hydro Tasmania commenced the process of mothballing the combined cycle unit, and in January 2015 it sought the Tasmanian Government's approval to sell the unit. In August 2015 Hydro Tasmania announced that the combined-cycle unit was not required for energy security and would be decommissioned and sold. The open-cycle units would be retained for peaking duty. However, only a few months later in December, Hydro Tasmania hired 12 temporary workers at the plant, indicating that the combined-cycle unit may be used again to slow the rate at which Hydro Tasmania's dam storages were depleted.\nOn 21 December 2015, Basslink, the HVDC interconnector with Victoria, was disconnected due to a faulty interconnector. It was originally expected that Basslink would be repaired and returned to service by 19 March 2016; however, the link was not restored until 13 June 2016.

Each turbine consists of a 67-metre-high (220 ft) tower and 40-metre-long (130 ft) blades, and so are 107 metres in height to the tip of the blade. These wind turbines rotate at speeds between 9 rpm and 19 rpm, depending on the wind speed. The wind yield in South Australia enables Canunda to produce electricity at a 34 per cent capacity factor, a high yield by global standards.The wind farm generates enough electricity to supply around 30,000 average South Australian homes. The Canunda Wind Farm distribution line is 16 km long and transports the generated electricity from the wind farm to a nearby substation at Snuggery. The distribution line traverses mostly roadside verges, avoiding areas of environmental sensitivity along the route. The Canunda Wind Farm provides a number of benefits to the local and wider community, including clean electricity generation, enhanced agricultural viability of the farms involved and increased diversity of electricity supply for South Australia and the south east in particular. There has also been widespread community interest in the project and site tours have commenced.The Canunda Wind Farm was opened by the Premier of South Australia, Mike Rann, on 31 March 2005. The project was completed on time and on budget and Wind Prospect provided engineering support to the owners of the wind farm, International Power, during the construction phase.

When it was officially opened in June of that year it was Australia's largest wind farm at 91 megawatts (122,000 hp). The installation consists of 55 wind turbines covering 17.5 square kilometres (6.8 sq mi)and was built at a cost of 180 million Australian dollars. It is connected to ETSA Utilities electricity transmission system via a 132 kilovolt line.The location was chosen after identification as having one of mainland Australia's highest average wind speeds. The wind farm was officially opened by South Australian Premier Mike Rann and Southern Hydro Chairman, Dr Keith Turner. The opening was opposed by some of the local Indigenous Australians, the Adjahdura (or Narungga). A descendant of the traditional landowners argued that construction desecrated an ancient burial ground, disturbing skeletons in the construction of turbine number four. Work was halted in late 2004 after the discovery of human remains, artefacts and tools. The Aboriginal Affairs Department, and the developers, separately commissioned archaeological reports resulting in the development allowed to proceed with five towers being repositioned. Both reports concluded that the bones had come from elsewhere on the peninsula, being later reburied at Wattle Point. The region's aboriginal community was divided on construction; Narungga National Aboriginal Corporation supporting development and the Narungga Heritage Committee strongly opposing.Wattle Point Wind Farm was built and owned by Southern Hydro Pty Limited. Southern Hydro was owned by Meridian Energy of New Zealand until October 2005, when it was bought by the Australian Gas Light Company (AGL). The windfarm was acquired by Alinta in October 2006, as part of an asset merger with AGL, and subsequently by the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group's Energy Infrastructure Trust, for 225 million dollars on 23 April 2007.\n\nThe District Council of Yorke Peninsula approved a second wind farm, Wattle Point Stage 2.

They are adjacent and are often considered a single facility. They have 18 wind turbines, with a maximum generating capacity of 35.4 MW of electricity. The original Albany Wind Farm was commissioned in October 2001, after ten years of planning. The wind farm has the capacity to produce 80 per cent of the electricity requirements of Albany.Originally commissioned in 2001 the farm was the largest of its kind in Australia.\nThe farm originally had 12 wind turbines, with 6 extra turbines installed in 2011 as the Grasmere Wind Farm. The  original Albany Wind Farm turbines are ENERCON model E66, each with three 35 metres (115 ft) long blades made from fibreglass and kevlar (making them very flexible in order to withstand any conditions) and are fitted to 65 metres (213 ft) towers. The nose cone which the blades attach to weighs around 14 tonnes. At the time of construction these turbines were the largest installed in the southern hemisphere. The turbines operate automatically, with the three blades adjusted to make best use of power output from any wind direction or strength. They have been designed to withstand the strongest winds likely in Albany and incorporate special lightning protection. Each turbine has a rating of 1.8 MW and is able to produce electrical energy at wind speeds of 7\u2013130 kilometres per hour (4\u201370 kn) at which the turbines are shut down. Maximum output is achieved at a wind speed of 50 kilometres per hour (27 kn). The 6 new turbines installed in 2011 are ENERCON model E70 with a rating of 2.3 MW. The turbines were made in Germany.\nThe Albany and Grasmere wind farms are situated on the coast about 12 kilometres (7 mi) south-west of the city. They are in an elevated position at approximately 80 metres (262 ft) above the Southern Ocean. The height and locality is designed to maximise exploitation of local wind conditions, and combined with the short distance to the main electricity transmission system make this an outstanding wind farm site.The farms also acts as a tourist attraction in Albany. When built A$200,000 was spent on board walks, viewing towers, interpretive displays and picnic areas on and around the site. The road to the site underwent a A$400,000 upgrade for better access for visitors.

The dishes each focussed the sun's rays on a collector, where water was boiled. The resulting steam drove a three-cylinder Uniflow steam engine, made by modifying a Lister diesel engine, delivering up to 25kWe. Batteries were used to provide 24-hour power to selected buildings in the township, and an existing diesel generator retained to provide battery charging when either low insolation or strong winds prevented use of the solar station for extended periods.In 1996, following grid connection of the township, the station was converted to photovoltaic. The dishes were resurfaced, and the original collectors each replaced by a cluster of 16 water-cooled photovoltaic cells. In its new form, the station delivers up to 45kWe. The batteries, and diesel generator were removed, and the output fed into the grid.\nThe grid connected power station ran for around 6 years, generating valuable data on the long-term performance and efficiency of the modules.

The initial plant was two 2.5MW BTH/English Electric turbo alternators that were no longer needed at Ultimo power station. A third 2.5MW turbo alternator from Zarra Street, Newcastle was added in 1931. A fourth 2.5MWBTH machine was installed in 1936 (ex Zarra St). In 1943 a 2.5MW Willans & Robinson generator from Zarra St became No5 at Lithgow. Steam was supplied from four 160,000 lb/Hr boilers at 200PSI and a temp of 450degF. Coal came from the nearby State Mine. Due to a severe lack of water, these turbines only exhausted into individual jet condensers.\nThe second stage of Lithgow power station development started in 1948 with the removal of No5 which had been damaged and the installation of a 7.5MW Metro-Vickers alternator from Zarra St and became No4A. Similar 7.5MW Metro Vickers generators replaced the 2.5MW machines in 1950, 1953 and 1956 to become No. 3A, No. 5, No. 2 and No. 1. Steam was supplied from five 70,000 lb/hr boilers that were ex White Bay \"A\" station. A series of wooden cooling towers were constructed and allowed the use of surface condensers for these larger sets. Make-up for the cooling towers came from a new dam built at the adjacent State Mine. Total output was 38MW.\nLithgow remained in operation until 1964 and was demolished during the 1970s."}, {"wikipedia": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Power_Station", "wikidata": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q21834601", "wiki_id": "Gordon_Power_Station", "wikidata_id": "Q21834601", "name": "Gordon", "name_original": "Gordon Power Station", "description": "The Gordon Power Station is the largest conventional hydroelectric power station in Tasmania, Australia; located in the South West region of the state.
